# Grid Composition Painting Project

## [Live Demo](https://pbain63.github.io/grid_composition-painting_project/)

---

## Overview

This project is a creative CSS grid-based composition inspired by modern art and abstract painting techniques. The layout is constructed entirely with HTML5 and CSS3, no images or JavaScript—focusing purely on design through code.

It’s an artistic experiment and an educational showcase for:

- CSS Grid layout capabilities
- Color theory in UI
- Minimalist visual design through code

---

## Project Highlights

- Inspired by **Mondrian-style** abstract painting
- Built with semantic HTML and advanced CSS Grid layout
- Responsive design that adapts to screen size
- Clean and scalable CSS structure for experimentation

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — semantic structure
- **CSS3** — CSS Grid, FlexBox, custom colors, border spacing
- **Git & GitHub** — version control and deployment via GitHub Pages
